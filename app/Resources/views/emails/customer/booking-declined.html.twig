Hi {{ booking.getName }},

Unfortunately, your booking request with {{ business.getName }} has been declined. This may because a therapist was no longer available, earlier appointments overran or other reasons that simply mean the time and treatment has become suddenly unavailable.

Your requested treatment details were;

{{ treatment.getName }} + {{ treatment.getDuration }}
{{ offer.getCurrentPrice }}<Treatment price and discount>
{{ availability.getDayText }} {{ availability.getTimeText }}

{{ business.getAddress.getAddressString }}
{{ business.getMobile }}
{{ business.getEmail }}

If you have questions about the treatment or appointment, please get in touch with <Business name> directly.

Not to worry â€“ there may be other discounted treatments available in your area available for you to book.
